/// the flattened schema leaves, so a leaf's ordinal is a property of the file it
/// was written into, not of the column. A multi-file read resolves projections and
/// predicates once against the first file (the reference schema) and must translate
/// those reference ordinals before indexing into any other file's metadata.
///
/// The translation is by field path: two files agree on a column when the same path
/// carries a compatible leaf, wherever that leaf happens to sit.
///
/// Pruning one file's row groups and pages needs two things in that file's own ordinals, so
/// both travel here: the filter, translated, and which of the file's leaves carry bounds in
/// an order this reader can read — a property of the file that wrote them.
