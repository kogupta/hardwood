/// - the annotation names no order — parquet-format defines none for `INTERVAL`, `GEOMETRY`,
///   `GEOGRAPHY`, `VARIANT`, `LIST` and `MAP`, and asks that `INTERVAL` record no bounds at all,
///   and a `NULL` column stores no values to order;
/// - the file names an order this build does not recognize, which `parquet.thrift` says to treat
///   as a column whose `min` / `max` are to be ignored;
/// - the reader dropped the column's annotation, either because this build does not recognize
///   it or because the column's physical type cannot carry it. The column reads as its physical
///   type, but its writer recorded the bounds in the order of the annotation, which the
///   physical type's order need not agree with. The "Unsupported Logical Types" section of
///   `LogicalTypes.md` has readers ignore the column order of such a column.
///
/// Bloom filters and dictionaries are unaffected: both test exact stored values, which does not
/// depend on how those values order.
